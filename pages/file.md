Core philosophy
===============

At the we redefine translational medicine by adhering to a foundational
philosophy that optimises our processes beyond merely implementing
cutting-edge methods. This dedication ensures that every member and tool
within our unit contributes towards a unified, efficient framework aimed
at enhancing operational and medical precision.

The challenge {#the-challenge .unnumbered}
-------------

Previously, our team faced significant delays due to inefficient
collaboration and repetitive searches for essential data, such as
patient statistics or file locations. These redundancies hindered our
progress and diluted our focus.

Our approach {#our-approach .unnumbered}
------------

1.  **Unified structure**: We maintain a consistent framework for all
    projects under the Precision Medicine Unit, enhancing setup and
    integration.

2.  **Single source of variables**: All project-related data is tracked
    via a centralised system, eliminating the need for repetitive
    searches.

3.  **Standardised format**: We implement a uniform format across all
    operations to ensure quick and easy access to necessary information
    without confusion.

The impact {#the-impact .unnumbered}
----------

These strategies ensure seamless updates across projects when new data
is integrated, akin to the efficiency of a robust digital codebase
[@potvin_levenberg_google_ACM]. This system not only boosts our
operational efficiency but also amplifies our capabilities in
translational medicine.

Philosophy before tools {#philosophy-before-tools .unnumbered}
-----------------------

We prioritise our strategic approach over specific tools. Our commitment
to a single-source, everything-as-code philosophy necessitates the use
of tools that support shared variables and robust data integration. We
opt for industry-standard and preferably open-source options like
Markdown, LaTeX, R, and Python, ensuring that core data remains secure
and all software and document source codes are public. This philosophy
not only streamlines our internal processes but also aligns with our
translational medicine efforts, enabling more efficient and effective
application of innovative clinical methods.
