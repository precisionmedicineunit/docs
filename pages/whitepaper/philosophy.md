Core philosophy
===============

At the precision medicine unit, we redefine translational medicine not
merely through implementing cutting-edge methods but through a
foundational philosophy that optimises our processes.

The challenge {#the-challenge .unnumbered}
-------------

Clinical and research teams currently spend extensive time manually
collaborating and searching for critical data such as patient statistics
or file locations. While this manual approach may suffice for small
projects, it becomes a significant bottleneck as projects scale in
complexity and size. This redundancy slows progress and dilutes focus,
making it an unsustainable practice for larger initiatives.

Our approach {#our-approach .unnumbered}
------------

1.  Unified structure: We employ a consistent framework for all projects
    under the precision medicine unit umbrella, streamlining setup and
    integration.

2.  Single source of variables: All project-related data is tracked via
    a centralised system, eliminating repetitive searches.

3.  Standardised format: A uniform format across the board ensures quick
    access to necessary information without confusion.

The impact {#the-impact .unnumbered}
----------

These strategies allow for seamless updates across projects when new
data is added, mirroring the efficiency of a robust digital codebase
[@potvin_levenberg_google_ACM]. This system not only enhances
operational efficiency but also deepens our translational medicine
capabilities.

Philosophy before tools {#philosophy-before-tools .unnumbered}
-----------------------

We prioritise our strategic approach over specific tools. Our commitment
to a single-source, everything-as-code philosophy demands the use of
tools that support shared variables and robust data integration,
avoiding traditional tools like MS Word and Excel in favour of
industry-standard and preferably open-source options like Markdown,
LaTeX, R, python, etc. This also means that core data is secure and safe
while the source code for all software and documents can be safely made
public.

This philosophy not only streamlines our internal processes but also
aligns closely with our translational medicine efforts, enabling us to
apply innovative clinical methods more efficiently and effectively.
