Key performance indicators
==========================

To ensure that our research and clinical implementations are both
effective and efficient, the precision medicine unit will track
performance using a well-defined set of Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs). These KPIs are carefully chosen to reflect crucial aspects of
our operations, from data management to user engagement and compliance.
We also aim to take the production burden off individuals and instead
place it on the joint group effort to determine our own pace, remaining
flexible to for worker satisfaction and development.

Our KPI framework includes the following metrics, each designed to
provide insights into specific operational aspects:

-   **Data Throughput:** Measured by the total gigabytes (GB) of data
    processed weekly, this indicator helps assess our capacity to handle
    large-scale genomic datasets.

-   **Turnaround Time:** This KPI tracks the duration from sample
    receipt to the delivery of the report, crucial for evaluating our
    efficiency in processing and reporting.

-   **Research Output:** Annually quantified by the number of papers
    published and tools developed, reflecting our contribution to
    scientific knowledge and tool innovation.

-   **Error Rate:** This is calculated as the number of errors per 100
    analyses, providing a clear measure of the precision and reliability
    of our data analyses.

-   **User Satisfaction:** Determined by averaging scores from user
    surveys, this metric gauges the satisfaction of clinical staff and
    researchers with our tools and reports.

-   **Compliance:** Measured by the percentage of successful compliance
    checks, this KPI ensures that our operations adhere to all relevant
    regulatory and ethical standards.

-   **Cost Efficiency:** This is evaluated by the cost per analysis or
    report, helping us monitor financial efficiency in our operations.

-   **Training and Uptake:** The percentage of cases using new tools
    measures the adoption rate of our latest methodologies and
    technologies, indicating the effectiveness of our training programs.
