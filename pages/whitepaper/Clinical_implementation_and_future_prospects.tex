\section{Clinical implementation and future prospects}

Our multi-omics data inform precision medicine protocols, guiding treatment plans that are specifically tailored to individual genetic profiles, thus enhancing treatment efficacy and minimising adverse effects. The prognostic models developed from our multi-omics data facilitate early interventions and enhance disease management strategies.

Looking to the future, we are dedicated to integrating single-cell sequencing and additional omic technologies, such as lipidomics and glycomics. These advancements are expected to considerably refine our understanding of diseases at a resolution that was previously unattainable. This development is anticipated to improve our diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic interventions, ensuring that Kinderspital Zurich continues to lead in paediatric healthcare innovation.
