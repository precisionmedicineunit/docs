\section{Project management}

We will manage intricate projects that encompass multiple stakeholders and complex data streams. 
Employing Jira, an advanced project management tool, we can clearly oversee tasks, timelines, and dependencies, ensuring that every phase of our projects conforms to our exacting standards and strategic objectives. 
This dynamic approach underpins our adaptability, facilitating the efficient execution of our research and clinical activities.

The documentation and outputs of our research will be rigorously curated from the first step to ensure transparency and accessibility, adhering strictly to our existing and future standards. 
Sensitive data will be secured and protected in BioMedIT to adhere with patient confidentiality and data integrity. 
Data transfers between BioMedIT and Kispi will follow standard guidelines and use secure methods such as sFTP backed by data transfer agreements.  
Stringent data stewardship is critical for maintaining trust and ethical standards in our research.
