Funding model and sustainability
================================

The precision medicine unit will benefit from a diverse funding model
that includes institutional support, competitive research grants, and
strategic partnerships with industry leaders. This multifaceted approach
provides a robust financial foundation that helps ongoing research and
development in paediatric precision medicine. Institutional support from
Kispi and its affiliated academic entities should furnish a stable base
of funding that sustains core facilities and staffing requirements.

Beyond traditional funding avenues, we may proactively establishes
collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms.
These partnerships frequently catalyse joint research projects and grant
access to avant-garde technologies and additional streams of funding. By
harmonising our research objectives with the needs of our industry
partners, we not only secure essential resources but also ensure that
our research outputs are pragmatically applicable and rapidly
translatable into clinical settings.

Furthermore, we are dedicated to integrating sustainable practices to
sustain all facets of our research activities, from data management and
analysis to resource utilisation. Our goal is to build a system that is
redundant to decay. To do so, we must produce tools that are sensible
for newcomers to learn, provide a consistent method of production and
usage so that they can be updated and maintained without dependency on
single members.

The most common research funding pathways for academic members of the
precision medicine unit are shown in **figure

opportunities that are also supported by UZH assistance are provided in
