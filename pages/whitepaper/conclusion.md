Conclusion
==========

The precision medicine unit is purpose-built to meet immediate and
achievable healthcare needs by implementing a streamlined and efficient
system. This approach circumvents the complexities and delays often
associated with incremental changes spread across numerous groups or
departments. By centralising efforts with a core team and focusing on
integrating advanced omics technologies with current medical practices,
the precision medicine unit can rapidly adapt and apply scientific
advancements directly to patient care. This direct implementation
pathway ensures that we not only meets current health standards but also
sets a robust foundation for future enhancements. Our model of operation
emphasises single-source management and open-source advancements. This
enables us to deliver reproducible and traceable results that are
understandable both internally and externally.
